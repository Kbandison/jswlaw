        "**Flat Fees**: For routine matters like real estate closings or simple business formations, we often charge a predetermined flat fee. This provides cost certainty and allows you to budget accordingly.",
        "**Hourly Rates**: For complex matters requiring extensive research or ongoing representation, we may charge an hourly rate. We'll provide estimates and keep you informed of time spent on your matter.",
